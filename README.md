<!# john’s lawn equipment analysis  

this project explores real operational data from john’s lawn equipment to evaluate supplier quality, employee retention, and production efficiency. using excel and python, i applied regression modeling, forecasting, and learning-curve analysis to uncover insights that support data-driven business decisions.  

the analysis includes predicting the effect of a supplier improvement initiative, identifying what factors influence employee retention, and modeling production learning to forecast future time savings. while this was originally a classroom case, i expanded it with python for reproducibility and visualization.

### skills used  
- data cleaning and preparation (handling missing values, organizing data, labeling columns)  
- regression modeling and forecasting in excel and python  
- multiple regression analysis to predict employee retention  
- time-series and trend analysis for supplier defects  
- learning curve modeling to forecast production efficiency  
- data visualization (line charts, scatterplots, trendlines, matplotlib)  
- business interpretation and recommendation building  
- storytelling through data and presentation design  

---

### tools and packages  
- **excel:** regression analysis, forecasting, dashboards  
- **python:** pandas, numpy, matplotlib, statsmodels  

---

### datasets analyzed  
- supplier defects (before and after quality initiative)  
- employee retention data (education, gpa, age, tenure)  
- production engine data (learning curve times)  

---

### insights discovered  
- supplier improvement efforts led to a significant reduction in material defects (around 30–40%).  
- education level and gpa were the strongest predictors of retention, while age had less impact.  
- production times decreased steadily as experience increased, showing measurable efficiency gains.

### key takeaway  
even without prior context, this project shows how data can reveal the story behind operational performance — turning spreadsheets into strategy and insights into action.
